# Chapter #6-Assignment #5
# Programmer: Denise Tranberg
# Date: 10/3/2017
#
# Program Title: 4 programs using functions.
#
# 1) Write a function that takes 5 int arguments and returns the largest of the 5.
# 2) Write a Python program to perform the task of temperature conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
#   Note that given C as the degree of temperature in Celsius, the corresponding degree F in Fahrenheit equals 1.8*C + 32.0.
#   For example 50 degree Celsius should be 122 degree Fahrenheit.
# 3) Continually prompt the user for an integer.  Constrain the userâ€™s input to integers between 1 and 50,000.
#   You can assume that the user will enter an integer and not a string or floating point number.
#   Make sure you have a way of exiting the function.
# 4) Write a function that calculates that computes the balance of a bank account with a given initial balance and interest rate,
#   after a given number of years. Assume interest is compounded yearly.
